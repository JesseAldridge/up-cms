I've set up Postfix on a Digital Ocean server running Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS. When I send a message to any gmail address it gets marked as spam. I worked through a bunch of problems on https://www.mail-tester.com and now have a 10/10 score, but still my messages are marked as spam.

SPF is correct
DKIM is correct
DMARC is correct
TLS is set
My site is not blacklisted anywhere
Reverse DNS is correct
MXE Record is set
PTR record is set

MX Toolbox reports no issues except for a warning about "SOA Expire Value"  (which based on my research shouldn't matter) https://mxtoolbox.com/Pro/domain/wintercms.com#/

I'm using namecheap.com as my DNS provider.

Here the last lines from `/var/log/mail.log`:

According to this thread: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/multiple-ptr-reverse-dns-records-postfix It looks like the way to get reverse DNS working right with Digital Ocean is to rename your server through their interface to `mail.<mydomain>`, which I did. That's why you sometimes see `mail.wintercms.com` in the output above and other times just `wintercms.com`. I'm not sure if this is related to my problem.

I'm running a basic NodeJs server on the same box on port 80. I don't think it's relevant, but in case it is, here is the code: https://github.com/JesseAldridge/winter-cms/blob/master/server.js

I have only ever sent a handful of emails from this server -- less than 100 test emails manually sent to various accounts I control over the course of today.  I have tried varying the body contents and subject contents of my messages.  The command I use to send the messages is similar to this: `echo "hello gmail i am testing you" | mail -s "this is my subject" -a "From: root@wintercms.com" JesseAldridge4@gmail.com`

If I login to a recipient gmail account I can manually mark the message as "not spam" and from then on additional messages will arrive in the inbox for that recipient. But of course it would look ridiculous if I have to tell customers to dig my initial email out of their spam folder and click "not spam" before they can start receiving emails from me.

The reason the Gmail client gives for marking the messages as spam is always "It is similar to messages that were identified as spam in the past." Which is not helpful since it doesn't describe these mysterious other messages at all or say why *they* were marked as spam.

I see a similar question was asked here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24654209/email-flagged-as-spam-with-correct-authentication But it appears the guy was not able to resolve it. The question is 4.5 years old and the guy is using Django whereas I'm using Postfix.

The above StackOverflow question references an alternate blacklist checking site. And that one does show my site blacklisted in one database out of sixty or so: https://www.dnsbl.info/dnsbl-database-check.php I have no idea why. I contacted the service via their contact form but have not heard back. I'm not sure if this is the source of my problem.

This site http://www.surbl.org/surbl-analysis says my ip is not blacklisted.
